今天的原文来自Medium，摘录了Jordan Peterson的书《12 Rules for Life》中的十二条法则。这本书我没有看，我摘录了豆瓣上的一个书评放这里。
> 这本书包括了Jordan Peterson的生活十二法则，不管是对个人，还是对社会，都是一剂良药。
> 
> 贯穿这本书的一个主题就是人生并没有那么绝望，个人的改变是可能的，生活有希望变得更好。毫无疑问，从小事做起，你可以每天进步一点点。生活的本质是一个悲剧，这个世界也并不那么友好，但我们要正确地对待这些问题，而不是一味地扮演一个受害者的角色，像祥林嫂一样，活在过去的阴影里；或者像一个巨婴，拒绝成长。
> 
>生活的十二条法则，用JP自己的话来说就是一些让你不再可悲的法则，因为他本人也是这些法则的实践者，而且他正实践着，所以他说的这些并不是空中楼阁。他对自己的缺点和不足之处也非常坦然地承认，而不像有的作者一味地自吹自擂。

> If you make happiness the meaning of life, every time you’re not happy, you’ll feel like a failure.

###Rule 1. “Stand up straight with your shoulders back.”
立正站好，抬头挺胸。

If you face a bad day with a good attitude, it can still be a meaningful one. 
Posture holds power. 
While you can overdo the “fake it till you make it” of how you carry yourself, making an effort to not collapse in the face of adversity(逆境) — both mentally and onto the couch — is empowering(有力量的). 

You control whether you walk straight or slouch, whether you smile or look grumpy, whether you focus on what went wrong or what needs to be done. 
Reminding ourselves of this control when times are tough can dramatically transform our experience of how tough times actually are.

**Show up, stand straight, smile. Conquer your attitude, conquer the day**.

### Rule 2. “Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping.”
善待自己，就像善待我们有责任好好对待的他人那样善待自己。

The only perspective we have on life is our own, and since we have to look at everything that’s in it, it’s easy to miss things. Our friends, however, see only small parts of us — but those parts they can see clearly.

It’s easy to see a relationship isn’t working when it’s not yours. When it’s your friend making the career choice, the answer seems obvious.

Ask yourself: “**What would my friends tell me to do?**” What would a neutral observer see and say? If you can look into the mirror and tell your reflection the tough truth they need to hear, you’ve finally learned to act in your own best interest.

### Rule 3. “Make friends with people who want the best for you.”
交真朋友

True friends connect with you because you believe in the same things. 
**Honesty**, **curiosity**, **humility**, whatever they are, upholding(保持) those beliefs will often mean putting your interests above their own — and that’s what true friends do. You deserve true friends.

### Rule  4. “Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today.”
要攀比，但要正确地攀比，不是和别人比，而是和昨天的自己去比。

A woman who earns $500,000 per year will feel great in a neighborhood where everyone else makes $250,000, but she will be miserable in Dubai.

If you must compare, look at yesterday’s photographs of yourself. Look at how far you’ve come, what you can be proud of, and remember what you’ve learned along the way. But whenever you can, don’t compare at all.

### Rule 5. “Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them.”
不要让孩子做让自己讨厌他们的事情。

When your son punches a fellow student, it’s not his behavior that makes you angry. It’s the failure as a parent that stings. “What example did I set that he wanted to punch him in the first place?” That’s an ugly question to answer.

If you don’t want to bail your kids, your partner, your friends out of trouble, teach them how to become the kind of person that does not get into it. **Be aware of the example you set every day**.

Defend moral lines if you must, but as long as you can, assemble those around you on the same side of those lines by showing them what taking a stand actually looks like.

### Rule 6. “Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world.”
先把自己的事情处理好

We have a saying in Germany: “If everyone sweeps in front of their own doorstep, the streets will be clean.” It’s true. Unlike our streets, however, our personalities will always offer more reasons to keep sweeping.
You’re never done becoming, and there’ll always be things left to improve. Every morning, pick one of those things to work on. Focus on that.
Look inside, fight your own demons, and by 4 PM, you’ll find yourself smiling at your neighbor rather than shouting at them — because one hard battle every day is enough.

### Rule 7. “Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient).”
追求有意义的生活，而不是一时的欢愉。
### Rule 8. “Tell the truth — or, at least, don’t lie.”
不要撒谎，因为撒谎会让我们变得脆弱，我们自己能感受到，别人也能感受到。但是说真话又很难，因为事实的真相本身就很难说清，所以至少不要说谎。

### Rule 9. “Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don’t.”
假设和你对话的人知道一些你不知道的事情。
### Rule 10. “Be precise in your speech.”
说话不要含糊，要准确。
其实很重要的一点是有话一定要说出来，因为只有说出来了，清楚地表达了，问题出在哪里才会一目了然，而唯有如此，才有解决问题的可能。
### Rule 11. “Do not bother children when they are skateboarding.”
当孩子们在玩儿滑板的时候不要去打扰他们，滑板是很危险的运动，滑板的精髓就在于其危险。

### Rule 12. “Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street.”
