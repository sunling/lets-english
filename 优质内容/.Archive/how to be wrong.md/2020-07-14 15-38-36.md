Some of our mistakes are easier to admit to than others. If you underestimated, say, the amount of time it would take to change a tire? Most people probably wouldn’t have a problem saying so.

But when it comes to our deep-rooted beliefs and worldviews, we have a stake in remaining steadfast in what we’ve told ourselves is true. Most folks see being wrong as a mark of shame instead of a prerequisite to self-improvement. As the journalist Kathryn Schulz wrote in her book Being Wrong, we often see errors as “evidence of our gravest social, intellectual, and moral failures.”

That’s what culture has taught us. Think about it. How often do you say to yourself at the end of a day: “I believed something this morning that I no longer believe now.” In my adult life, this revelation occurred almost never.

It’s been my loss. There are great benefits to being wrong: When you learn to punctuate everything you believe with a question mark, you open yourself to the discovery of knowledge. You routinely discard old views in favor of perspectives that are informed by evidence, history, and a variety of opinions. You find a whole new way of navigating the world.

I wanted to learn how to challenge my own assumptions — not just around certain issues, but as a habit. So I created what I called the 30-Day Becoming Wiser Challenge, which involves both a morning and an evening routine. Here’s how it works.

### Morning routine
The morning routine primes your mind to stay open and investigate reality throughout the day ahead.

Ask yourself this question: What belief will I be wrong about today? You’ll want to document your answer somewhere, like a journal, a voice memo, or a note on your phone.

Focus on something specific. You might even want to start with something small and low-stakes (“Milk should be poured before adding the cereal”). Once you get in the habit of asking yourself the question each day, you can move onto bigger, more personal topics.

Decide how you’ll seek out information to disprove your belief. Will you schedule a conversation with someone who believes the opposite? Will you read information from sources you don’t normally check? Put these tasks on your to-do list or schedule them in your calendar.

Prepare for blowback. Ask yourself how your family, friends, or peers might judge you for changing this belief you’ve identified. One reason we resist admitting we’re wrong is that we fear how it will look in the eyes of others. So prepare yourself for it. Plan an explanation for why you’ve adopted a new belief, own it, and move on.

### Evening routine
Your evening routine prompts self-reflection that helps you cement the habit of questioning your assumptions.
Ask yourself this question: What was I proven wrong about today? Once again, document your answer.

If it’s “nothing,” explain any areas in which you were challenged. Even if you confirmed what you already believe, it’s good practice to see the gray areas and holes in every stance.

Think about how you were challenged or proven wrong.

Did you seek to prove yourself wrong, allow someone else to do it, or both? In this exercise, it’s helpful to both seek out information on your own and open yourself to challenges from others.

Wherever you documented your answer, add a few sentences about what you learned from the experience. When you feel the rush of excitement from discovering something new, you’ll be more open-minded the next time a belief comes into doubt. If you weren’t proven wrong or challenged at all, don’t worry. It took me several days of this practice before I developed enough awareness to recognize my resistance to being wrong.

Reward yourself if you made it through the day and successfully disproved something you believed, or at least opened yourself for future questioning. Treat yourself to something small — a square of dark chocolate works for me. Think of it as a way to reinforce the behavior and train your brain to favor doubt over certainty.

For me, this exercise has been transformative. I learned to see being wrong as a path for growth rather than a statement about my inadequacy.

It takes about 30 days to grow comfortable with being wrong. You’ll find yourself less certain and more doubtful, but that’s a good thing. As the philosopher, Bertrand Russell once wrote: “The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts.” Once you get in the habit of looking for ways to disprove your beliefs, you’ll find yourself more willing to accept criticism, challenges, and new information. And in doing so, you can transform your work, your relationships, and yourself.
