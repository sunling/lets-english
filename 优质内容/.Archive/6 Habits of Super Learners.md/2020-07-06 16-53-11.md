超级学习者的6个习惯
 
Becoming a super learner is one of the most important skills you need to succeed in the 21st century. 

在技术变革的时代，**保持领先**(Staying ahead)取决于持续不断的**自我教育**。

Many polymaths(博学家) (people who have excelled in diverse pursuits) — including Charles Darwin, Leonardo da Vinci and the Nobel prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman — claimed not to have exceptional natural intelligence.

Better learning approaches can make the process enjoyable. The key to rapid skill acquisition(习得) isn’t complicated. 

If you aim to learn a new skill to improve your career this year, some of these habits can be useful for you.

### 1. Super learners read a lot  
很多人问，你为什么要阅读？

**Reading is to the mind what exercise is to your body**. 
* It gives us the freedom to roam the expanse of space, time, history, 
* and offer a deeper view of ideas, concepts, emotions, and body of knowledge.

In fact, many of the most successful people share this appreciation for **reading** — 
they don’t see reading as a chore but as **an opportunity to improve their lives, careers and businesses**.
事实上，许多很成功的人都对阅读有着同样的态度——他们并不把阅读看作是一件烦琐的事，而是一个改善生活、事业和事业的机会。

Elon Musk grew up reading two books a day, according to his brother. Bill Gates reads 50 books per year. Mark Zuckerberg reads at least one book every two weeks. Warren Buffett spends five to six hours per day reading five newspapers and 500 pages of corporate reports.
据马斯克的哥哥说，马斯克从小就每天读两本书，比尔盖茨每年读50本书，扎克伯格每两周至少读一本书，巴菲特每天花5到6个小时阅读5份报纸和500页公司报告。

In a world where information is the new currency, reading is the best source of continuous learning, knowledge and acquiring more of that currency.
在一个以信息为新货币的世界里，阅读是持续学习、知识和获取更多信息的最佳来源。

### 2. Super learners view learning as a process
过程比结果更加重要。

Learning is an enjoyable lifelong process — a self-directed and self-paced journey of discovery. 
Understanding any topic, idea or new mindset requires not only *keen observation* but more fundamentally, **the sustained curiosity**.
学习是一辈子的事，是一个愉快充实过程——一个自我导向和有着自己节奏的发现之旅。
理解任何话题、想法或新的思维方式，不仅需要*敏锐的观察力*，更重要的是需要**持续的好奇心**。

More than ever, **learning** is for life if you want to stay **relevant**, **indispensable** and thrive in the changing world of work.
如果你想在不断变化的工作环境中保持相关性、不可或缺并茁壮成长，学习比以往任何时候都重要。

Super learners value the process. They don’t have an end goal, they seek consistent improvement. 
超级学习者重视过程。他们没有最终目标，他们寻求持续的改进。

### 3. They adopt a growth mindset
成长型心态。

Growth mindset — a learning theory developed by Dr Carol Dweck that revolves around the belief that 
**you can improve intelligence, ability and performance**.
**成长型心态**——Dr Carol Dweck提出的一种学习理论，它围绕着这样一种信念：
**你可以提高智力、能力和表现**。

>The illiterate(文盲) of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot **learn**, **unlearn** and illiterate  ----Alvin Toffler

Alvin Toffler认为：“21世纪的文盲将不是那些不会读写的人，而是那些不会学习、忘却和重新学习的人。”。

The ability to keep an open-mind, acquire better knowledge and apply it when necessary can significantly improve your life and career.
能够保持开放的心态，获得更好的知识，并在必要时加以运用，可以
