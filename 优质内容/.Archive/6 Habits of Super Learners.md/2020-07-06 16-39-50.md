超级学习者的6个习惯
 
Becoming a super learner is one of the most important skills you need to succeed in the 21st century. 

在技术变革的时代，**保持领先**(Staying ahead)取决于持续不断的**自我教育**。

Many polymaths(博学家) (people who have excelled in diverse pursuits) — including Charles Darwin, Leonardo da Vinci and the Nobel prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman — claimed not to have exceptional natural intelligence.

Better learning approaches can make the process enjoyable. The key to rapid skill acquisition(习得) isn’t complicated. 

If you aim to learn a new skill to improve your career this year, some of these habits can be useful for you.

### 1. Super learners read a lot  
很多人问，你为什么要阅读？

**Reading is to the mind what exercise is to your body**. 
* It gives us the freedom to roam the expanse of space, time, history, 
* and offer a deeper view of ideas, concepts, emotions, and body of knowledge.

In fact, many of the most successful people share this appreciation for **reading** — 
they don’t see reading as a chore but as **an opportunity to improve their lives, careers and businesses**.
事实上，许多很成功的人都对阅读有着同样的态度——他们并不把阅读看作是一件烦琐的事，而是一个改善生活、事业和事业的机会。

Elon Musk grew up reading two books a day, according to his brother. Bill Gates reads 50 books per year. Mark Zuckerberg reads at least one book every two weeks. Warren Buffett spends five to six hours per day reading five newspapers and 500 pages of corporate reports.
据马斯克的哥哥说，马斯克从小就每天读两本书，比尔盖茨每年读50本书，扎克伯格每两周至少读一本书，巴菲特每天花5到6个小时阅读5份报纸和500页公司报告。

In a world where information is the new currency, reading is the best source of continuous learning, knowledge and acquiring more of that currency.
在一个以信息为新货币的世界里，阅读是持续学习、知识和获取更多信息的最佳来源。

### 2. Super learners view learning as a process
过程比结果更加重要。

Learning is an enjoyable lifelong process — a self-directed and self-paced journey of discovery. 
Understanding any topic, idea or new mindset requires not only keen observation but more fundamentally, the sustained curiosity.
学习是一个愉快的终身过程——一个自我导向和自我节奏的发现之旅。理解任何话题、想法或新的思维方式，不仅需要敏锐的观察力，更重要的是需要持续的好奇心。

“A learning journey is a curated collection of learning assets, both formal and informal, that can be used to acquire skills for a specific role and/or technology area,” writes Sonia Malik of IBM.
Learning is an investment that usually pays for itself in increased earnings. More than ever, learning is for life if you want to stay relevant, indispensable and thrive in the changing world of work.
Super learners value the process. They don’t have an end goal, they seek consistent improvement. They keep mastering new principles, processes, worldviews, thinking models, etc. The “ongoing, voluntary, and self-motivated” pursuit of knowledge is important for their maturity.


IBM的Sonia Malik写道：“学习之旅是正式和非正式学习资产的集合，可用于获取特定角色和/或技术领域的技能。”。
学习是一种投资，通常是通过增加收入来获得回报。如果你想在不断变化的工作环境中保持相关性、不可或缺并茁壮成长，学习比以往任何时候都重要。
超级学习者重视这个过程。他们没有最终目标，他们寻求持续的改进。他们不断掌握新的原则、过程、世界观、思维模式等。对知识的“持续、自愿和自我激励”的追求对他们的成熟很重要。


3. They adopt a growth mindset
You can’t go wrong cultivating a growth mindset — a learning theory developed by Dr Carol Dweck that revolves around the belief that you can improve intelligence, ability and performance.
“The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn and relearn,” argues Alvin Toffler, a writer, futurist, and businessman known for his works discussing modern technologies.
Cultivating a growth or adaptable mindset can help you focus more on your most desirable goals in life. It may influence your motivation and could make you more readily able to see opportunities to learn and grow your abilities.
The ability to keep an open-mind, acquire better knowledge and apply it when necessary can significantly improve your life and career.


4. Super learners teach others what they know
According to research, learners retain approximately 90% of what they learn when they explain/teach the concept to someone else, or use it immediately.
Teaching others what you know is one of the most effective ways to learn, remember and recall new information. Psychologists, call it the “retrieval practice”. It’s one of the most reliable ways of building stronger memory traces.
Learn by teaching someone else a topic in simple terms so you can quickly pinpoint the holes in your knowledge. It’s a mental model coined by the famous physicist Richard Feynman.
Known as the “Great Explainer,” Feynman was revered for his ability to clearly illustrate dense topics like quantum physics for virtually anybody. The Feynman Technique is laid out clearly in James Gleick’s biography, Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman.
The ultimate test of your knowledge is your capacity to transfer it to another. A better way to learn, process, retain and remember information is to learn half the time and share half the time. Example, instead of completing a book, aim to read 50 percent and try recalling, sharing, or writing down the key ideas you have learned before proceeding.

5. Effective learners take care of their brains
Keeping your brain healthy keeps it sharp. What you do or don’t do for your brain can significantly change how your record, process and retrieve information. Everyone wants to live an active life for as long as possible. And that goal depends on robust brain health.
That means eating lots of foods associated with slowing cognitive decline — blueberries, vegetables (leafy greens — kale, spinach, broccoli), whole grains, getting protein from fish and legumes and choosing healthy unsaturated fats (olive oil) over saturated fats (butter).
Fruit and vegetables combat age-related oxidative stress that causes wear and tear on brain cells,” says Dr Gary Small, a professor of psychiatry and ageing.
Our brains naturally decline if we do nothing to protect them. However, if you intervene early, you can slow the decline process — it’s easier to protect a healthy brain than to try to repair damage once it is extensive.

6. They take short breaks, early and often
Downtime is crucial to retaining anything you choose to learn. According to recent research, taking short breaks, early and often, can help you learn things better and even improve your retention rate.
“Everyone thinks you need to ‘practice, practice, practice’ when learning something new. Instead, we found that resting, early and often, maybe just as critical to learning as practice,” said Leonardo G. Cohen, M.D., Ph.D., a senior investigator at NIH’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.
Better breaks help the brain solidify, memories during the rest periods. Whatever you choose to learn over time, it’s important to optimise the timing of rest intervals for better results.
Experts at the Louisiana State University’s Center for Academic Success recommends 30–50 minutes sessions. “Anything less than 30 is just not enough, but anything more than 50 is too much information for your brain to take in at one time,” says learning strategies graduate assistant Ellen Dunn.
Our brains’ neural networks need to time process information, so spacing out your learning helps you memorise new information more efficiently — give your brain enough time to rest and recover.
