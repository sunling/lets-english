Cheering yourself up. It’s not about avoidance. It’s about recognition. It’s about self-love. It’s your day. It’s your moment. It’s your life. It’s worth it.

If you’re feeling in a funk, here are 10 Ways to Cheer Yourself Up.

### 1. Feel it.
Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor is a neuroanatomist(神经学解剖学家) – a brain scientist who studies the anatomy of the brain. 
She had a stroke. She watched her brain functions shift and alter. She watched how her brain processed, or didn’t process, stimulation. She found out that if she let herself feel an emotion, it would pass in about 90 seconds. 
所以不要逃避你的感受，然后希望它会消失。
不会的！
只有当你
如果你能让自己感觉到的话
So don’t avoid what you’re feeling in the hopes it will just go away. It won’t. It will if you let yourself feel it though.

### 2. Observe things.
### 3.  Master your mind. …or, just give it a little test-run.
### 4. Rock your body.
### 5. Clear the slate.
### 6. Gather your hall of champions.
###  7. Ask for help.
###  8. How do you want to feel?
### 9. The quickie.
### 10. Say thank you.
