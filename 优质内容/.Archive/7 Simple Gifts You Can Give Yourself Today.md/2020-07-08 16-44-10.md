If you want to change your life, change how you think about it. Here are seven shifts you can make today that can greatly improve tomorrow.

#### 1 Some slack.
You cannot solve all of the world’s problems before lunch. Do what you can, and don’t feel guilty about what you can’t. You’re pulling your own weight, and that’s enough.

#### 2 Some forgiveness.

You messed up. You forgot something. You spent time unwisely. You spoke unkindly. You’re not evil. You’re just human.

#### 3 Some time.

If you are exhausted, find a room with a door and hide in it. If no such room exists, escape to the outdoors for at least fifteen minutes. You earned that time.

#### 4 Some entertainment.
Watch the cat video. Stream the sappy movie. Read the pulpy novel. Consider it a form of vacation.

#### 5 Some optimism.

Tomorrow will be better. You will learn more. You will feel better. You will hone your skills, your crafts, your outlook. Don’t worry. You’ll figure out how.

#### 6 Some goals.

You need a destination, a deadline, a reason to move forward. Goals dissolve listlessness. Give yourself one.

#### 7 Some control.

Give yourself permission to be in charge of yourself. Switch the voice in your head from passive to active and let your opinions matter.
