If you want to change your life, change how you think about it. Here are seven shifts you can make today that can greatly improve tomorrow.

#### 1 Some slack. 懒散
每天午餐前不能解决完所有的问题，做自己可以做的，对自己不能做到的不要感到自责。
You cannot solve all of the world’s problems before lunch. Do what you can, and don’t feel guilty about what you can’t. You’re *pulling your own weight*, and that’s enough.
(pull your weight: to do your fair share of work that a group of people is doing together 完成自己那份工作 )


#### 2 Some forgiveness. 原谅
是人都会犯错、搞砸、忘记东西、浪费时间、说话不友好等等。原谅自己。
You messed up. You forgot something. You spent time unwisely. You spoke unkindly. You’re not evil. **You’re just human**.

#### 3 Some time. 放松
为了下一件事情完成的更好，学会给自己放松。
If you are exhausted, find a room with a door and hide in it. If no such room exists, escape to the outdoors for at least fifteen minutes. You earned that time.

#### 4 Some entertainment.

Watch the cat video. Stream the sappy movie. Read the pulpy novel. Consider it a form of vacation.

#### 5 Some optimism.

Tomorrow will be better. You will learn more. You will feel better. You will hone your skills, your crafts, your outlook. Don’t worry. You’ll figure out how.

#### 6 Some goals.

You need a destination, a deadline, a reason to move forward. Goals dissolve listlessness. Give yourself one.

#### 7 Some control.

Give yourself permission to be in charge of yourself. Switch the voice in your head from passive to active and let your opinions matter.
