Life Kit: What Makes A Good Partner — And How To Cultivate Connection
是什么因素决定你是一个好的另一半？ 如何培养一段良好的长久的关系？

学校里没有设置恋爱课堂可以让我们去学习如何处对象。 我们都要靠自己慢慢去探索答案。无论你有没有谈过恋爱，每一段新的关系都是“初恋”，对恋爱双方来说，都是第一次跟对方去相处。如何选择及选择谁来投入我们的时间和经历去谈恋爱？又怎么去处一段健康的关系？都是大学问啊。

希望对大家有点参考作用，文末还有关于识别更加合适的人及怎么处关系的4个steps， 下面我放上了这集内容的音频和我的学习笔记。
(北京时间每周日10pm我会跟在腾讯会议上跟大家一起来分享和讨论Life Kit频道的内容。如果你也刚兴趣，文章末尾有加入方式)s

>When you're looking for a partner, the thing to choose if you're interested in a long-term, satisfying relationship is someone who makes you feel great about who you are. Like, it's such a simple thing, but it matters enormously
当你在寻找伴侣时，当然前提是你对长期的幸福的关系感兴趣，那可以找能认可你欣赏你并且让你觉得自己很不错优秀的人。这听起来很简单，但是却非常重要

**4 tips on how to cultivate a good anfrim relationship**:
1. We have a choice in who we invest our time and energy into. When looking for a partner, Mandy recommends seeking out people who make you feel good about yourself, people who don't make you feel small.
我们可以选择谁来投入我们的时间和精力。在寻找伴侣时，Mandy建议寻找能让你对自己感觉良好的人，而不是让你感到自己很渺小的人。

2. Instead of just thinking about the qualities you're looking for in a partner, think about how a person chose an investment in you and your relationship. Date people who respect your interests and who celebrate your wins.
不要仅仅考虑您在伴侣中寻找的素质，而要考虑一个人如何选择对你和你们之间的关系的投入。跟尊重你的兴趣约会吧，跟喜欢庆祝生活中的点点滴滴的人约会吧，跟热爱生活的人约会吧。

3. Vulnerability is important, but it's a good idea to ease into it. Talk about something that's important to you, or share a funny story you wouldn't tell a stranger. If you're unable to offer someone the generosity and love you want to receive in a relationship, it might be a sign that it's time to move on.
脆弱每个人都有，很重要，但是慢慢分享你的脆弱是一个好主意。选择对你很重要的事情来谈论，或者分享一个有趣的故事，你一般不会告诉陌生人的故事。如果你无法向对方提供想要在一段关系中获得的慷慨和爱意，则可能表明该继续前进了。

4. Lastly, not everyone is going to want to be in a long-term, committed relationship. Romantic love can take many forms, and what you need will look different at different times in your life.
最后，并非每个人都希望保持长期，坚定的关系。
浪漫爱情可以是多种形式，而且你所需要的东西在生活中不同时间会有所不同。
