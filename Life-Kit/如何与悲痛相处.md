2020年12月20日10pm跟大家在腾讯会议上分享了我对NPR下的播客频道Life Kit这集内容——Poet Tracy K. Smith On Grief In The Holidays And 'Different Vocabularies For Feeling的学习过程。我个人是非常喜欢这集，里边很多表达方式我都非常喜欢，太多共鸣的地方。 分享其中一个takeaway：人活着，伤痛总是会有，任何东西没有永远的拥有。

希望你们喜欢。现在暂定每周日10pm直播分享我每期内容的学习过程，如果你感兴趣，文末扫码加入微信群。

以下是这集内容的音频以及我的学习笔记。

to exacerbate: [ɪɡˈzæsərˌbeɪt] 使…恶化 使…加剧 
**02**
> When I was a kid, I watched the winter holidays shift for my family after my mother died

**03**
> And this year, **in the middle of** the pandemic, I lost an uncle, and it feels **surreal** still not being able to gather with family to **mourn**, not having the usual traditions to help direct our grief. I've had to figure out ways to honor his life on my own

in the middle of sth/doing sth  == 在…中
surreal:  离奇的 超现实的 something surreal is so strange that you cannot believe it is real 
to mourn: 哀悼
**04**
>I'm **bracing** for the holidays, both in terms of the isolation but also because of this atmosphere of grief, not knowing what we will lose still or what the ripple effects of this loss looks like. And I know I'm not alone

to brace:  to get ready for something unpleasant  使…有所准备
**05**
>And so much of her work centers on loss. Tracy K. Smith's collection of poetry, "Life On Mars," won a Pulitzer Prize

to center on: 专注在 == focus on 
Pulitzer Prize: 普利策奖。Tracy是美国诗人和教育家。从2017年到2019年，她担任美国第22届诗人桂冠。她出版了四本诗集，并因其2011年的《Life on Mars》而获得普利策奖。她的回忆录《Ordinary Light》于2015年出版。

> I was wondering - I mean, so much has happened in 2020. There are so many people, there are so many things to grieve. In general this year, how have you been thinking about grief?

to grieve for sb为..感到悲伤
**07**
> I feel **a deep wish to connect** to my parents, who are both gone, because **I would love to know what they could tell me about having lived through**, you know, their history. They both grew up in the Jim Crow-era South

非常喜欢这样的表达方式：
to feel a deep wish to connect to….
I would love to know what they could tell me about having lived through….
**08**
>I particularly grew up doing to honor the dead was burning incense for Lunar New Year

grow up doing 长大以来一直做的

**09**
> And I feel like it's so important to embrace the fact that** it will always hurt. Something will always be gone**. And that space is something that it's important to guard and to mark and to understand that there's also - I don't know - something else that gathers there

我觉得接受这一事实总是很重要，因为伤痛总会有，很多东西会永远消失。而且这个空间是很重要的，需要保护，标记和理解
**10**
>  And what I love about what you're saying about the incense is marking a space, **conjuring** a space where I can be present, **mindful** and **attentive** to, you know, what might linger in some way, what might see or sense me in some way

>What resonated with me so much is just hearing Krista talk about that slow work of rebuilding traditions and inability (ph) to come together as a family

what resonated with me: 与我产生共鸣的是
**14**
>We talk about self-care. And I feel like self-care in large part is about ministering to the reality of our own pain and exhaustion and giving ourselves what we need to to fuel up

>Sleep, bee, deep 
>and easy. Hive. Heave.
>Give. Grieve. Then rise, when you're ready, from your soul's hard floor to sweet work or some war
