Why You Feel So Guilty When You're Not Working？当你在不工作时，为什么会感到内疚？

> So the way to **work around** guilt has to do with sort of changing the way that you frame your environment, the way that you reset your expectations, the way that you restructure your life so that the guilt is less likely to sort of show up in the first place

所以解决内疚的方法就是改变你对环境的看法，重新设定你的期望，重新调整你的生活......
说到底，**如果我对事情有负面看法，只因我缺乏建设性的视角**

下面我放上了这集内容的音频和我的学习笔记。(北京时间每周日10pm我会跟在腾讯会议上跟大家一起来分享和讨论Life Kit频道的内容。如果你也刚兴趣，文章末尾有加入方式)

**01**
>  But somewhere in my 40s, it began to **dawn on** me that all my hard work wasn't making me any happier or healthier


dawn on: to begin to be understood or realized by (someone) for the first time 开始明白 意识到 
The solution finally dawned on him. 
It suddenly dawned on me that I hadn't eaten all day. 
It began to dawn on her that she was lost.

**02**
>So began a **years-long** investigation of my own addiction to toxic productivity to **uncover** its roots and the possible **antidote**

uncover: 揭露 to find out about something that has been hidden or kept secret
antidote: 解药 对抗的手段 Laughter is a good antidote for stress 

**03**
>Today we'll **dig into** the **psychological underpinnings** of our society's addiction to checking email and setting up one more Zoom call

dig into: 探查 探究
underpin: verb, to be an important basic part of something, allowing it to succeed or continue to exist. 加固….的基础
psychological underpinnings: 心理基础

04
>Well, we had a loneliness **epidemic** for quite some time in America, and it's only getting more and more **exacerbated**. And that, of course, has a lot of **detrimental** effects on people's anxiety, also their depression and their physical health

epidemic：传染病  蔓延
exacerbate: to make a problem become worse  使…恶化
detrimental: harmful 有害的

05
> We don't become better, more relaxed, more **grounded**, more mindful versions of ourselves overnight or not even over the course of a year. But the pandemic and all the challenges that we've been facing from showing light onto health inequalities, racial inequalities

我们不会在一夜之间变得更好，更放松，更脚踏实地，更专注，甚至不会在一年的时间里变得更好
grounded： 脚踏实地

06
>So **given that**, it would make sense that we would feel guilty when we don't meet them or when we feel like we haven't met them. That's what guilt is there for, right? It's a signal that things are not going the way we think they should.

鉴于此，当我们没有完成一些事情或者我们觉得我们没有完成时，我们会感到内疚是说得通的。
这就是内疚存在的目的，对吧？这是一个信号，表明事情没有按我们认为应该的方式发展

07
>So the way to **work around** guilt has to do with sort of changing the way that you frame your environment, the way that you reset your expectations, the way that you restructure your life so that the guilt is less likely to sort of show up in the first place

所以解决内疚的方法就是改变你对环境的看法，重新设定你的期望，重新调整你的生活，这样内疚就不太可能在第一时间出现
work around: 解决

08
>It's a bit of a **riff** on the "Year Of Yes."
有点像 Year Of Yes的翻版
riff: a short series of notes in jazz or popular music that is repeated often throughout a piece  重复的音键

**10**
>She's very successful in her career, so people are constantly asking her to do more and do more. And it gets positively **reinforced** - right? - because the more she does, the more praise she gets, the more **accolades** she gets, but obviously, the more she's stretching herself thin

reinforce: to make an idea, belief, or feeling stronger  加强 加深
accolades: an honour given to someone for their work 荣誉 


**11 **
>Paradoxically, we have this tendency to want to do more and more and more and achieve goals because we get this **dopamine** hit every time we accomplish something

矛盾的是，我们倾向于做越来越多的事情并实现目标，因为每次完成某件事时，都会受到**多巴胺**的造访

**12**
>We talk about being really focused and sort of thinking in a tunnel vision, and that's really helpful when you need to accomplish something. 
>But we also need time to sort of to let our minds explore, to let ourselves be. Sometimes in psychology, we refer to it as broadening our attention. The "mindless activities" in a way are actually in some ways the most important ones to our mind.

我们谈论的是真正的专注，在一个隧道式的视野中思考，当你需要完成一些事情的时候，这真的很有帮助。但我们也需要时间让我们的思想去探索，让我们可以做自己。有时在心理学中，我们称之为拓宽我们的注意力。在某种程度上，“无意识的活动”实际上在某些方面对我们的思想来说是最重要的。

**13**
>I also find it **mind-boggling** how much our work mentality - this sort of addiction to productivity and efficiency - has **bled into** our personal lives, the personal choices we make.

我还发现，**令人难以置信**的是，我们的工作心态——这种对生产力和效率的沉迷——已经**渗入**了我们的个人生活及个人选择之中。
bleed:  (lose blood) 流血  过去分词bled  

**14**
>That's a technique from cognitive behavioral therapy that is called **exposure**, right? So the more we do the things that make us anxious, the less anxious they make us over time. So I did a bit of therapy on myself. I did a bit of exposure on myself.

**Exposure therapy** is a psychological treatment that was developed to help people **confront** their fears. When people are fearful of something, they tend to avoid the feared objects, activities or situations.
满灌疗法（flooding therapy）也称暴露疗法、冲击疗法或泛滥疗法，该方法基于Foa和Kozak的情绪加工理论 。 暴露疗法分为实景暴露和想象暴露 ，不给患者进行任何放松训练，让患者想象或直接进入最恐怖、焦虑的情境中，以迅速校正病人对恐怖、焦虑刺激的错误认识，并消除由这种刺激引发的习惯性恐怖、焦虑反应。

**15**
>So unless you're all of a sudden deleting a lot of important stuff and facing negative consequences in your work or unless you're upsetting certain people who were really counting on you responding or any other similar scenario - unless any of those scenarios **materializes** or is at risk of materializing

materialize: to happen or to become real 实现
