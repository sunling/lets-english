我一直觉得听英语播客，不仅仅是学习英语，播客里边有很多优质的内容，我更加关注的是内容，只不过是内容是以英语体现，那就顺便来提升自己的英语水平。

北京时间每周日10pm我会跟在腾讯会议上跟大家一起来分享和讨论Life Kit频道的内容。如果你也刚兴趣，文章末尾有加入方式。

上周日(2020年12月27日)的内容是关于如何开始记录日记——Feeling Lots Of....Feelings? Journaling Can Help
每每看我之前的记录，过去很多记忆很多画面又会浮现在眼前，虽然我的记录非常随意，但还是会感激过去的自己记录了。 记录日记不是解决问题的方式，但是是一个反思、发现自己和了解自己的一种方式。一旦开始记录，请一直记录下去。
