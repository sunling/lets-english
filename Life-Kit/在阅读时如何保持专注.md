-What's the hardest part about reading a book?
我想阅读一本书最困难的拿出一本书打开去阅读，我觉得阅读跟跑步很类似，去跑步最难的一件事，是穿上舒适的衣服和跑鞋，只要一切都准备好了，迈开腿反而简单了。 

阅读跟跑步稍微有点区别的时，我们越来越难静下心来去享受阅读。在阅读时我们如何尽量去保持专注？

今天的播客内容关于「How To Focus While Reading」，有谈及到非常有用的3个tips：
- Takeaway No. 1 is reading asks a lot of your brain. If you struggle to read for any reason, it's not because you're not smart.  阅读需要很多专注力，如果你出于任何原因而很难静下心来阅读，并不是因为你不聪明。
- Takeaway No.2  is drop everything and read. Read whatever you want, but make time for it.  不论读什么，请安排时间去阅读。
- Takeaway No.3 is if you want to read more, make sure you have books all over your life 如果你想多读书，一定要让你的生活中到哪里都有书可阅读。

希望对大家有点参考作用，文末还有4个关于如何阅读的strategies， 下面我放上了这集内容的音频和我的学习笔记。
(北京时间每周日10pm我会跟在腾讯会议上跟大家一起来分享和讨论Life Kit频道的内容。如果你也刚兴趣，文章末尾有加入方式)

**01**
> There's also **perspective-taking**. Critical analysis - **inferential**, **deductive**, **inductive reasoning**

Perspective-taking: 观点采择
观点采择的本质特征在于个体认识上的去自我中心化，即能够站在他人的角度，从他人的角度看待问题.  
inferential 推论
deductive  演绎
inductive reasoning 归纳推理

**02**
>Folks with **dyslexia**, folks who just can't seem to **pick up** a book and all of y'all who worry that social media just **rotted** your brain and now you can't read anymore

dyslexia 诵读困难 dəsˈleksēə

**03**
>People who do read a lot can have a little bit of snottiness about it. Everybody has a little bit of snottiness about what they read

snottiness: 自大
snotty 自以为是的

**04**
>Juanita's advice for folks who are **struggling to pick up** a book is that you don't have to read some massive **doorstopper** like she's reading

struggling to do sth: 努力做某事，苦苦挣扎
doorstop 厚书

**05**
>So like, my **dishy celeb memoir** is fine. It's a book. And I'm actually reading it, which is not exactly what happens when I try to read really heavy, difficult nonfiction.

dishy: 漂亮的 性感的
celeb== celebrity  名人
memoir: 回忆录

**06**
But our next takeaway is just **carve** the time out of your day or night to stop scrolling Instagram or **fretting** about tomorrow to do what my elementary school teachers used to call **DEAR** time.

carve:  挤出 划分(时间)
fret: verb 苦恼 
to fret about or over sth 为某事发愁
DEAR time: DEAR stands for drop everything and read

**07**
>I think Juanita has a point that being a reader can seem like this sort of **aspirational** label that we put on

aspirational: wanting to be successful and have a better job, home etc than you already have  有志向的

**08**
>You're listening to a **hypocrite** who collects **buzzworthy** books but doesn't necessarily read them

hypocrite: /ˈhɪpəˌkrɪt/ 伪君子
buzzworthy: new and interesting in a way that attracts or deserves widespread talk or attention 新颖有趣的

**09**
> If you want to read more, make sure that you have books all over your life

如果你想多读书，一定要让你的生活中到哪里都有书可阅读。

**10**
>I think she's **spot on**. And the one thing that both Juanita and Manju **stressed** is that you don't necessarily need a paper book

spot on: exactly correct 在点子上
stress: verb 强调

**11**
>But the truth is, if you **scavenger** hunt your books and bury them in all of the corners of your life - in your phone and on your e-reader and all over - you will be more likely to make time for those pages.

但是事实是，如果**拾荒者**搜寻书籍并将其藏在生活的各个角落-放在手机和电子阅读器中，甚至遍布整个角落-你将更有可能为这些页面腾出时间。

**12**
The next step is called **gist reading**, which I'll give you the gist of. It's basically where you skim everything that you've got and you get a sense for it.

gist reading 要点阅读

**13**
you're looking to gather that information to really - what we call **content acquisition**

context acquisition 语境习得 理解上下文

**14**
>Takeaway four is a little **Russian nesting doll of advice**

Russian nesting doll: are a set of wooden dolls of decreasing size placed one inside another 俄罗斯套娃
