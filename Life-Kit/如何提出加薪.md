 LIFE KIT: How To Ask For A Raise: Know Your Value (And Bring The Evidence)
如何提出加薪：认清你的价值(有理有据)

在这集的life kit里，主持人和嘉宾针对如何提出提薪展开了讨论：
怎么更加充分地去准备提出加薪？
谈判过程中怎么体现你及你的职位带来的价值？
遇到「加薪不在预算内」应该如何应答
如果加薪请求被拒绝了应该怎么办？

加薪看起来是一个向外求的过程，但更多的是向内看。 在提出加薪请求之前，应该有一个自我评估。
例如可以问自己：
Have I met or sort of exceeded the expectations that people had for me in my role
在我的这个职位里我曾有超出过其他同事对我的期望吗？
Writing down things like your accomplishments and aligning them up with the expectations that people have for you in that role
有没有一些成就，是同事们非常认可的？
Have you taken on other projects? Have you taken on more responsibilities
有没有做过职责范围之外的一些项目？有没有榄下更多的职责？


以下是这集内容的音频和我的笔记。(北京时间**每周六9pm**我会跟在腾讯会议上跟大家一起来分享和讨论Life Kit频道的内容。如果你也刚兴趣，文章末尾有加入方式)

**01**
A lot of what we do around negotiations is really sort of focusing ourselves outward
关于协商，我们所做的很多事情实际上是把自己的注意力放在外面

**02**
And a lot of the times, what we really sort of **gloss over** is actually looking inward and thinking about the things that mean the most to us, things that we don't want to compromise, thinking even about our values or how we want to interact with people, how we want to show up in conversations
很多时候，我们真正掩饰的其实是向内看，思考对我们来说最重要的事情，我们不想妥协的事情，思考我们的价值观，我们思考如何与人交往，思考如何在谈话中表现出来

gloss over:  掩饰 ‹defect, unpleasant truth, detail›

**03**
In your book, you talk a lot about, you know, how **self-worth** and the **narratives** we tell ourselves - how those determine what we're willing to ask for. Can you talk a little bit about why that's such a big factor?
在你的书中，你谈论了很多关于自我价值和我们告诉自己的故事-这些如何决定我们愿意要求什么。你能谈谈为什么这是一个很大的因素吗？
self-worth 自我价值感
narratives 描述 ; 讲故事 ; 叙述 ; 叙事技巧 ; narrative的复数

**04**
I just think that, oftentimes, the narrative we have for ourselves, the perception that we have of ourselves is not that of value, right? We **knock** ourselves **down**. And, you know, there's a saying that if we talk to our friends the way we talk to ourselves, we wouldn't have any. It's because of sort of this lack of, you know, maybe self-love. And we sort of **lean** **into** criticism of ourselves. And it's so much easier when somebody gives us a compliment for us to sort of **brush** it **off**, whereas if somebody criticizes us, it sort of sticks on us. It's like a tattoo
我只是觉得，我们对自己的叙述，对自己的认知，往往不是价值观，对吧？我们击倒了自己。有一种说法是，如果我们像和自己说话那样和朋友说话，我们就不会有任何东西。是因为缺乏自爱。我们倾向于批评自己。当有人称赞我们时，我们会更容易不予理睬，而当有人批评我们时，我们会更难受，就像纹身一样。

know sb down: 击倒  打击
lean into: 倾向
brush off: 不理会

**05**
Studies show that those people who want more for themselves, who seek more **aspirational** outcomes actually get more aspirational outcomes, right? So it's a sort of positive psychology that plays into all this
aspirational: adj. 有雄心壮志的；（生活形态等）梦寐以求的

**06**
So I think those are really important questions to ask yourself because they become really **solid** data points that you could take into the conversation.
solid: adj. 固体的；可靠的；立体的；结实的；一致的

**07**
I want to talk a little bit about **leverage**, too. You know, I - there's obviously a power dynamic between your boss and you, the employee. How do we kind of reverse that and gain a little bit of leverage in our negotiation
leverage: the power to make someone do what you want 权力 影响力

**08**
It just feels like a big **hurdle** to overcome
hurdle: n. 障碍；栏；跳栏

**09**
I've been **trembling**. And, like, frankly, I kind of **black** **out** for some of the conversation out of nerves. Do you have thoughts on how to **dial** that **down**?
trembling: 发抖，战栗；担心
black out: v. 中断，停止；熄灭灯火；晕倒，昏厥
dial down: 降低 控制

**10**
being able to have that sort of what we call information exchange ahead of the actual transactional conversation really helps **alleviate** the pressure associated with the actual **bargaining** itself. It lets you connect with someone and actually enjoy the moment
alleviate: vt. 减轻，缓和
bargain: vi 讨价还价 谈判

**11**
Financially, they may be **strapped**
strapped: adj 缺钱的 手头拮据的

**12**
.Where you can actually take a vacation and it's not a **staycation** asking for an extra week.
staycation: 本地度假 [在国内度假或只在家附近景点游览]
