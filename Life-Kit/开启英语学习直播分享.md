每个星期日10pm我都会跟三四个小伙伴一起通过腾讯视频会议分享播客life kit频道的学习笔记，总共是一个小时，每周学习一集内容。现在已经连续两个多月了吧，一直在坚持的小伙伴的反馈都还很不错。

偶然发现腾讯会议有直播的选项，所以我计划**开直播**，跟大家一起在线分享和学习，我花点时间认真整理我的学习笔记，在内容方面还是会比较**随意**，如果分享中遇到不懂的我都会现场搜索，怎么读，怎么拓展之类的，这其实也是我主动学习的方式，我也想通过这种方式鼓励和带动大家一起学习，分享只是一个梳理和输出，主要的还是这个学习过程。 

下面附上我们上一周的学习内容音频以及我的学习笔记，topic是关于如何平衡自己的独处时间。文末有直播微信群的加入方式以及这一周的学习内容获取。

> Goldilocks principle

金发姑娘原则（ Goldilocks principle）来自英国作家罗伯特·骚塞的童话故事《三只小熊》，讲的是一位名为Goldilock的金发女孩进山采蘑菇，不小心闯进了熊屋，趁著熊爸爸、熊妈妈和熊小孩外出还没有回来，金发女孩把厨房里各种好吃的东西一扫而光，然后舒适地躺在熊的床上迷迷糊糊地睡着了，还做了一个美梦。
被金发姑娘霸占的房子中，每个熊都有自己的偏好的床、食物和椅子。金发姑娘在偷吃过三碗粥、偷坐过三把椅子、偷躺过三张床后，金发姑娘觉得不太冷或太热的粥最好、不太大或太小的床和椅子最舒适。
……直到有一天3只熊回来了，原来这间房子属3只熊所有，金发女郎的幸福生活就一去不复返了。由于童话故事在不同文化中都很流行，所以“恰到好处”的概念很容易理解并且很容易应用于广泛的学科，包括发展心理学，生物学，天文学，经济学和工程学。
