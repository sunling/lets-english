Faced With A Tough Decision? 正面临这艰难的选择？

今天的播客内容关于「How To Make A Hard Decision」，我听完内容后的一个启发是，艰难的选择面前，权衡利弊当然是必须的，因为这是对一件事或者一个人的作下承诺的过程。每一种选择代表着一种可能性，选择其一并不代表你即将犯下一个错误。内容也谈及到做艰难选择的两大错误：第一，以为大抉择一定很艰难；第二，以为其中一个选择一定比另一个好。当我们遇到很难做出决定的情况时，我们应该怎么做呢？

希望对大家有点参考作用，文末s还有关于如何抉择的6个steps， 下面我放上了这集内容的音频和我的学习笔记。
(北京时间每周日10pm我会跟在腾讯会议上跟大家一起来分享和讨论Life Kit频道的内容。如果你也刚兴趣，文章末尾有加入方式)

**01**
>So if you're **staring down** a big decision in 2021, you are not alone

因此，如果您正在盯着2021年的一个重大决定，那么您并不孤单。

**02**
>The pandemic has definitely **wrought** some big changes in our society. I think it's a great opportunity to think about how to think

wreak: cause (a large amount of damage or harm) 造成

**03**
>She's a philosopher and professor of **jurisprudence** at Oxford University, and one of Ruth's research areas is decision-making - how we can think about making hard choices.

jurisprudence [ˌdʒʊərɪsˈpruːd(ə)ns] 法学

**03**
>I feel like they really misconstrued your thinking

misconstrue: to understand something wrongly  误解

**04**
>Hard choices feel hard because, at least for me, it feels like so much is riding on it

it feels like so much is riding on it.不太好理解，我的理解是：有太多的事情要去考虑 

**05**
>Well, the first thing I would say is that it's really important to distinguish big choices from hard choices

如何区分大决定和艰难的抉择，很重要

**06**
>You get an operation that will cure some **debilitating** disease you have, so it's an easy decision

debilitate [dɪˈbɪlɪˌteɪt]:  to make someone physically or mentally weak  使…虚弱
debilitating : 使人虚弱的

**07**
>I think of a hard choice as a choice between **alternatives** where there's a bunch of things that matter in the choice between them

alternative: possible option 可能的选择

**08**
>And one alternative is better than the other **in some respects**, the other alternative is better than the other **in other respects**, and neither seems better overall. And so that's the **paradigmatic** **indicator** that you're in a hard choice

在某些方面，一个替代方案要比另一个替代方案好，在其他方面，另一个替代方案要比另一个替代方案好，而且从整体上看，这两个方案没有哪个胜过哪个。因此，这就是难以选择的典型指标
in some respects: 在某些方面
paradigmatic: [ˌpærədɪɡˈmætɪk]  providing a typical example or model of something 典型的
indicator: 指示器  标志

**09**
>And **on a par** means one isn't better than the other, but nor are they equally good because if they were equally good, then the right thing to do is to flip a coin between them.

“同等地”意味着一个选项并不比另一个选项好，但是它们也不是同等程度的好，因为如果它们同样好，那么正确的做法就是掷硬币。
on a par: as good as, equal to 相当于
This violinist may be an amateur but he's on a par with professional orchestral players

**10**
>And that is a kind of test you can perform on any **putative** hard choice you face to see whether it really is hard

这是一种测试，你可以对自己面临的任何假定的艰难选择进行测试，以查看它是否真的很难
putative: 假定的 believed to be something

**11**
>I have a lot of friends who are, I would call, like, **maximalists** or optimizers when they're thinking about decision-making. What has your work taught you about obsessing over those tiny, little distinctions when you're making a hard choice?

我有很多朋友，当他们考虑决策时，我会称他们为**最大化主义者**或优化者。当您做出艰难的选择时，你在工作中学到了什么，让你沉迷于这些微小的差异？

**12**
>The first biggest mistake in thinking about hard choices is thinking that, oh, well, they're just big. That's why they're hard - because the consequences are huge for my life. The second big mistake, I think, is **manifested** in the character you just described - the maximizer who tries to get every little bitty thing, you know, in favor of one alternative and tries to get the best that they can and **agonizes** over whether this small change in the one career then makes it better than the other

选择困难的两大错误，第一，认为大选择就很难，因为选择的后果和影响对生活可能是巨大的；第二，人们尽可能找到选择之间的所有微小差别来区分一个选项比另一个更好。
manifest: verb 体现
agonize: verb [ˈæɡəˌnaɪz] agonize over/abt
to spend a long time worrying and being upset about something. 焦虑不已

**13**
>That's a mistake because in a genuine hard choice, one isn't better.

在困难的选择中，往往不是一个就比另一个选择就更好

**14**
>The first step is you got to **ascertain** what matters in the choice between the alternatives

ascertain: verb to find out something 查明， 搞清楚 

**15**
>So first step - ascertain what matters. Second, you have to understand the pros and cons of the alternatives with respect to what matters. Third step - you tally up the pros and cons

所以第一步-确定什么是重要的。第二，你必须了解替代方案在重要方面的利弊。第三步-总结利弊
with respect to == in respect of 关于
tally up: 清点 整理

**16**
>So this is why hard choices are important - because they're like **junctures** in our life where we get to realize ourselves as one kind of agent as opposed to another, someone who has most reason to do this thing instead of that thing

所以这就是为什么艰难的选择很重要，因为它们就像我们生命中的一个转折点….
juncture: a stage in a process or activity 关头  紧急时刻
at this juncture 在此紧急时刻

**17**
>Instead of looking out into the world and trying to discover some nonexistent fact about which path of life is best for you, **you actually get to create that value for yourself by committing to things**.

你不需要去观察这个世界、去尝试发现一些关于哪条人生道路最适合你但不存在的事实，而是要通过对事情的承诺来为自己创造价值。

**18**
>But if you are affianced or in a committed relationship, it's because your commitment to that person makes that person the right person for you, and you give that person extra value by committing to them

但是，如果你已经结婚或者处于一段承诺的关系中，那是因为你对那个人的承诺让那个人成为你的合适人选，你通过对他们的承诺给了那个人额外的价值

**6 steps to be the author of your own life**
**A**: So first step - **ascertain** what matters.
**U**: Second, you have to **understand** the pros and cons of the alternatives with respect to what matters. 
**T**: Third step - you **tally up** the pros and cons
**H**: The fourth step is you **home in on** the fact of parity
**O**: Next step - you have to **open** yourself up to the possibility of making a commitment.
**R**: And when you do that, you finally **remake** yourself
Together, it spells **AUTHOR**, so you can be the author of your own life
