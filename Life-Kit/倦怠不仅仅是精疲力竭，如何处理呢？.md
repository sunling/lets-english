### 4 ways to deal with burnout 四种处理职业过劳的方式
**Takeaway No. 1 **- burnout is bigger than you think. It stems from chronic stress at work and involves physical and emotional exhaustion, feelings of dread and cynicism about your work and a sense of shame and guilt. It has serious consequences on individuals' mental health. It's also contagious and affects workplaces and society at large.
第一： 倦怠比你想象的要严重。它源于工作中的长期压力，包括身心疲惫、对工作的恐惧和愤世嫉俗以及羞耻感和内疚感。它对个人的心理健康有着严重的影响。它还具有传染性，影响工作场所和整个社会。

**Takeaway No. 2** - take control of your workday. One way to do that is by developing a practice of checking in with yourself and how you're doing a few times during your workday. And pay attention to your negative emotions and what's causing them. It'll help you address the causes of those emotions and take some control over your work life because lack of control, lack of boundaries, is a big factor causing burnout.
第二：掌控你的工作节奏。其中一种方法是，养成一种习惯，在工作日定期检查自己的情况。注意你的负面情绪以及导致它们的原因。它将帮助你解决这些情绪的原因，并对你的工作生活采取一些控制，因为缺乏控制，缺乏界限，是一个很大的因素造成倦怠。

**Takeaway No. 3** - know when you're working too much, and find ways to make your workload more manageable, and prioritize rest - every day, every week - and use those vacation days you've been saving for a year
第三，知道什么时候你工作太多了，想办法让你的工作量更容易管理，每天把休息放在优先位置，多多利用那些你攒了一年的假期

**Takeaway No. 4** - workplace structures and culture have a big impact on burnout risk, things like absence of social support at work or presence of bullying and discrimination, so workplace leaders have a very big role in both preventing and addressing burnout. Ultimately, it's more than individuals taking care of their own
工作场所的结构和文化对工作倦怠的风险有很大的影响，比如工作中缺乏社交支持或者存在欺凌和歧视，所以工作场所的领导者在预防和解决工作倦怠方面都有很大的作用。归根结底，不仅仅是个人照顾自己
