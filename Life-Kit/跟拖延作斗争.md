> Whether it's filing our taxes on April 14 or **filling up** your gas tank on the way to work instead of the night before like you thought you should, we all do it to **various extremes** and results

无论是在4月14日缴税，还是在上班的路上给你的油箱加满油，而不是像你认为的那样在前一天晚上加满油，我们都会采取**各种极端做法**，并产生不同的结果
fill up (gas tank)：加油
pump: (push) 用泵输送 pump air; pump gas  

**02**
> we’ll cover what procrastination is, how it's sometimes linked with **perfectionism**, **FOMO** fear of missing out

我们将讨论什么是拖延，它有时是如何与**完美主义**、FOMO(害怕错过)联系在一起的

**03**
> So procrastination is typically a **dysfunctional** way of **coping with** unwanted emotions and feelings of anxiety, depressive feelings, self-doubt or even fear. 
>**Chronic procrastination** is an inability to regulate negative or fearful emotions or feelings

因此，拖延是一种典型的**功能失调**的方式来**应对**不想要的情绪和焦虑、抑郁、自我怀疑甚至恐惧的感觉。
**慢性拖延症**是指无法调节消极或恐惧的情绪或感觉 

**04**
>  So **I was coming into this thinking** that procrastination was really literally just the act of putting things off. But it's - you're saying it's the act of putting things off because I'm struggling with an internal feeling

所以我开始认为拖延实际上只是拖延的行为。但你是说种拖延的行为是因为内心的挣扎
I was coming into this thinking: 我开始认为….

**05**
> What is it about the perfectionist personality that goes **hand in hand** with procrastination

完美主义者的性格和拖延症有什么关系
hand in hand with: 相关联的

**06**
> The perfectionism-procrastination process cycle - it **stems** from typically being uncomfortable with an emotion attached to doing, so either engaging in the behavior that you're putting off or engaging in a task. And so the thought is, OK, **if I can't do it perfect or if I don't believe I can do it perfect right now, then I just don't - I won't do it**. I'll just wait until I'm in a setting or situation where I can **be** completely **perfect** **at** it. And it's unrealistic and irrational because we typically are going to have some sort of reason why things can't be perfect. And what happens is people will wait till the very last minute because they have to do it

完美主义者和拖延过程周期。 它通常**源于**对一种与做本身有关的情绪感到不舒服，例拖延的行为，要么从事一项任务。
所以我的想法是，好吧，如果我不能做到完美，或者如果我不相信我现在能做到完美，那么我不会做。我只会等到我在一个环境或情况下，我觉得我可以非常完美地完成。但这是不现实和不合理的，因为我们通常会有某种原因来解释为什么事情不可能完美。人们会等到最后一刻，因为他们必须这么做

**07**
>And so procrastination and perfectionism is something that really has the ability to **cripple** us. And so it was so **imperative** that I do the work and I do the inner work. 
>To self-work initially was identifying, what were my barriers to productivity and identifying who and what was my **inner critic**

所以拖延和完美主义是真正有能力削弱我们的东西。所以我必须做工作，做内心的工作。 
自我工作最初是确定我效率的障碍是什么，确定内心的批评来自哪里
cripple: 削弱 压垮
imperative: 迫切的
inner critic: 内心批评 

**08**
>This is getting real **meta** for me right now.

这对我来说真的很重要。

**09**
> I've had to learn how to **combat** negative self-talk in context of procrastination. And it's really doing the inner work and identifying who your inner critic is, where your negative self-talk stems from. But what is important to understand is that your inner critic is **crafted** over time from an absorption from caregivers, from teachers, from coaches, from siblings, from failed relationships, failed friendships.

我必须学会如何在有拖延症的情况下与消极的自我对话作**斗争**。它实际上是在做内心的工作，确定你内心的批评家是谁，你消极的自我言谈从何而来。但重要的是要明白，你内心的批评是随着时间的推移从照顾者、老师、教练、兄弟姐妹、失败的关系、失败的友谊中**产生**的。

**10**
> And so understanding your thoughts and your feelings and then understanding what kind of behaviors follows allows us to **combat** and **work through** whatever barriers may be **in the way** of you procrastinating or you struggling with perfectionism.

因此，了解你的想法和感受，然后了解接下来会发生什么样的行为，可以让我们**战胜和克服**任何**阻碍**你拖延或与完美主义作斗争的障碍。

**11**
>We can always change our **narrative**

我们总是可以改变我们**叙事**的方式

**12**
> What would you say to someone who thinks they procrastinate because they're lazy or unmotivated?
> - I think it's very important to identify where those feelings are coming from, and if it is something they were told, if they're comparing themself to someone - and really processing and exploring where those negative thoughts about self come from
>- You're saying you're lazy. You're saying you're unmotivated. **Where would you like to be**?

如果有人认为他们拖延是因为懒惰或没有动力，你会怎么说？
我认为，确定这些感受的来源非常重要，是否被告知的，是否正在将自己与某人进行比较，有没有真正地处理和探索那些关于自我的消极想法是从何而来的
你是说你很懒，没有动力。你想要的状态是什么样的呢？

**13**
> Why do we procrastinate self-care and rest
>- I think cultural components typically **come into play** with that. It's like, we're taught to take care of everyone. It's programmed in us due to family dynamics, and we were socialized that way

我认为文化因素通常与此相关。就像，我们被教导要照顾每个人。这就像是，由于家庭的动态，我们被编程了，我们就这样被社会化了
come into play: 开始起作用

**14**
> And I think sometimes, we attach our self-worth to our own productivity, and we're only as valuable as how successful we are. And then that makes us almost put our own self-care and self-preservation on the **back burner**. Another concept that comes up is imposter syndrome. And what imposter syndrome is - it's the idea that we hold internally that we're only successful due to luck and not because of our own talent and our own **merit**

我想有时候，我们把自我价值和自己的生产力联系起来，我们的价值只取决于我们有多成功。这让我们几乎把自我关爱和自我保护放在了次要位置。另一个概念是冒名顶替综合症。什么是冒名顶替综合症？这是一种观念，我们内心认为，我们成功的唯一原因是运气，而不是我们自己的天赋和优点
on the back burner: 次要位置
put sth on the back burner 暂且搁置某事
merit: 优点 

**15**
> And so there is a need to be needed sometimes. And so by allowing ourselves to be productive and show up for somebody else can sometimes even be more easy or more satisfying than showing up for our own selves.

所以有时候有被需要的需要，让我们自己富有成效，为别人露面，有时甚至比为自己露面更容易或更令人满意。

**16**
>And so we all go through seasons. We all go through **ebb and flow**.  
>**It's OK to not be OK sometimes**

一年有四季， 我们也都会经历起起落落
