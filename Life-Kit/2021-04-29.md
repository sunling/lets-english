today's LIFE KIT episode is for everyone out there seeking guidance on comfort decorating
we'll be going over some tips on the best ways of creating calming, productive and restful spaces in your home.


Takeaway No. 1 - take a step back to first think about what you want or need to do in the space. And one of the best ways to do that is by dividing up your apartment or living room into different functional zones. Then you can start brainstorming on how you want to feel in the space.

Takeaway No. 2 - color. If you can, let loose. Don't be afraid to follow your gut and start with the hues that bring you joy, or choose colors based on what you hope to accomplish in the space

Takeaway No. 3 - patterns and fabrics help our brains to break up a monotonous space. The trick is finding the right level of visual complexity that works for you.

Takeaway number 4, comfort decorating is all about embracing nostalgia

Lastly, takeaway No. 5 - bring in some nature. Real plants, faux plants, a print of some nice scenery or wallpaper - it doesn't really matter as long as it reminds you that there is a world outside of your four walls.
